# Malware identifier 

This project consist on 4 notebooks working on the Kaggle malware identifier data.

- Data_preprocessing
- Data_cleaning
- Feature_selection_&_transformation.
- Model


# Installation


The project is stored in:

    https://github.com/lukyluca/Kaggle-Malware-identififcation


# Requirements

Python version 3.8

All packages in the used environment are reported in the file:

    requirements.txt


# Part 1: Data preprocessing

In this notebook I have explored the data, to get a first grasp of what will be required for the next steps. Starting with a univariate analysis of each column and continuing with a Multivariate analysis of variables two by two.

# Part 2: Data cleaning

In this part I will deal with null values and outliers in the dataset.

# Part 3: Feature selection and data transformation

In this part I will select the most important features to predict our target and perform the necessary transformation to these variables in order to run some sklearn algorithms 

# Part 4: MLOps plan for a store supply use case

In this part I will select the algorithm that yields the best score, and then tune the parameters of the algorythm in order to have the best predictions possible of the target
